The Checker’s Queue module is built using React with functional components and hooks. On the frontend, it renders a paginated and searchable table that displays work items assigned to the checker. We are consuming backend APIs exposed over HTTP using Axios. First, we call the getWorkFlowsByStatus endpoint to fetch all workflows that have moved to the checker stage. Since the workflow response does not directly include applicant names, we enrich each record by making an additional API call to getApplicantNameByUserId, which returns the applicant name as a string. This data is merged into the workflow objects and stored in component state. The UI supports full-text search across multiple fields including formatted Work Item IDs (like WI001), Loan IDs (like LN001), User IDs, Applicant Names, and Created Date. Client-side pagination ensures that only ten rows are visible at a time, and navigation is handled using Previous and Next controls. Each row displays a PENDING status badge and an action button labeled VIEW, which can be extended to open a detail modal or trigger workflow actions. For styling, we have used Bootstrap along with custom CSS for hover effects, rounded corners, and a consistent color scheme. The architecture is designed to be modular: API logic is separated into an apis folder, while the presentation layer is cleanly handled in the React component. Overall, the solution ensures a responsive, extensible, and production-ready interface for checker operations.”
