This is the Checkerâ€™s Queue, built using React for the frontend and integrated with backend APIs to fetch and display data in real time. The queue surfaces all pending work items for checkers in a clear and organized way. Data is dynamically rendered on the frontend by making API calls to the backend, ensuring that any updates in the workflow are instantly reflected without manual refresh. This creates a smooth and responsive experience for users, enabling them to efficiently track, review, and process tasks.
