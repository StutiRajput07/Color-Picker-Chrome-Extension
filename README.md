Planned: Add CIBIL credit-score and KYC API integration to enable automated risk-based decisions and identity checks.

Next-steps paragraph (simple)
Planned next step: connect third-party CIBIL and KYC services (using soft or hard checks with the applicant’s consent). This will let the system automatically verify identity, pull a credit score to assess risk, and apply configurable rules to approve, flag, or route applications — while keeping all checks auditable and user-consent driven.

Very short, plain-English explanation (for speaker notes)
We’ll call trusted credit and KYC services (only after the user agrees). The system will get a credit score and identity verification result, then use simple, configurable rules to decide if an application can be auto-approved, sent for manual review, or rejected. All checks will be logged for auditing and privacy protections (PII masking, encrypted storage).
